## Introduction

MarketCash is a private, secure, untraceable, decentralised digital currency. We know that the financial market and the economy are in constant transformation and most of the people are already inserted in the digital environment. In this context, blockchain technology comes to innovate and change radically how we make use of money to buy and sell products and services. Taking all this into account, our team intends to innovate using blockchain technology and thus, to reach a totally new level for the use of cryptocurrencies.

For this, we have the mission of being the largest platform for exchanging cryptocurrencies, being a reference for agility, ease and security. The first of our many goals is to accept numerous consolidated cryptocurrencies in our platform, as well as giving opportunities for new ones that are emerging.

Our next step will be to create Payment Gateways, exclusively to accept digital currency payments. This project will allow the integration into e-commerce systems and will be made available to products and services retail websites, thus breaking the barrier of which digital currency is only for investments.

In addition, digital wallets for storage of cryptocurrencies will be made available on our exchange, as well as exclusive applications for Android, iOS, Linux and Windows platforms.

Our team is very experienced and has the necessary knowledge to overcome the great challenges of the project. In the same way, we are very excited to give a new usability to the blockchain and the virtual currencies.
